                    Nicotine withdrawal causes smoke addicts to be irritable
                    and on edge when they do not smoke regularly.
                    This can affect the moods of yourself and the people around
                    you.

                    Smoking significantly increases the risk of the smoker
                    getting lung cancer, being the highest mortality rate of
                    all types of cancers. This is because smoking damages the
                    sensitive lung tissue, including DNA damage.

                    The nicotine in smoke reduces the amount of oxygen
                    being absorbed by your heart, raises blood pressure,
                    and increase the chances of a blood clot, leading to
